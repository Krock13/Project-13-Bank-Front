# Argent Bank - User Authentication and Transaction Management

## Project Overview

Argent Bank is an innovative banking institution aiming to establish a strong presence in the financial sector. Our recent project, in collaboration with Remede Agency, focused on developing a comprehensive web application for user authentication and transaction management.

The development journey was divided into two distinct phases. Phase 1 revolved around creating a user-friendly web interface for account login, profile management, and logout functionalities, all developed using React.js and Redux for state management. Phase 2, meanwhile, concentrated on specifying API endpoints for transaction management, documented in Swagger, to enable users to view and manage their transactions.

## Technical Highlights

- The application integrates Vite.js for enhanced performance and an improved development experience.
- State management is efficiently handled through React-redux and Redux toolkit, ensuring seamless state transitions and data handling across the application.
- The user interface is designed to be responsive, catering to a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
- The application's backend, developed by Argent Bank's in-house engineering team, provides robust API support for user authentication and transaction management.

## Backend Setup

The frontend application requires the corresponding backend to be installed and running. Please follow the instructions in the [backend repository](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API) to set up and launch the backend server.

Ensure that the backend server is running before you start the frontend to make all the features available and functioning correctly.
